# Estimate of how many hours you spent on the project

We started the project early and spent around 2 weeks on it approximately working an 6 hours each per week. Since we are two of us in the team the combined total number of hours spent on this project are 24 hours approximately.

# Description of how we tested the code

# Any bugs or issues you could not resolve

There are no bugs in the program.

# An example of a difficult issue or bug and how you resolved it

We got stuck on multiple things here and there but the most painful one was when we were trying to create a post with userid, we were sending the userid as a string but were expecting an integer on the backend in the create post endpoint. There were two solutions to this problem: 1. to type cast the userid into (int) on the backend or 2. Just send an integer to the backend. Because python uses 'dynamic typing' the error took longer to detect and resolve but we reslolved it by pair programming with each other.

# A list of the five extensions you’ve chosen to implement, be sure to describe the endpoints you’ve added to support this, using a documentation format similar to ours.

The five extensions we chose are list below and they are numbered the same way throughout the project:

1. Extension 1: Users and User Keys
2. Extension 2: User Profiles
3. Extension 3: Threaded Replies
4. Extension 4: Data and Time based range queries
5. Extension 5: User Based range queries

# Detailed summaries of your tests for each of your extensions, i.e., how to interpret your testing framework and the tests you’ve written
